# Latex-Equation-Classification-using-keras
Classify different latex equations into one of the four classes which are "Unknown, Simple, Fraction, Linear Equation For Degree One". Almost 20k latex equations were collected and then trained a keras based lstm model using that dataset. The final test accuracy was 98%.
